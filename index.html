    Am I created by a higher intelligence or by a random cosmic event? This is the question that tends to draw a divide between many religions and between scientists. There are many theories, beliefs and speculations that have sought to answer this existensial question. There can be parallels found between these explanations, but two things are for sure; our lives had a beginning, pointing to the indisputable fact of an end and within the many explanations of our origin, there exists one which holds the truth.
  </p>
  <p class="hidden">The scientific method seeks to answer the How, the What, the When, by and from Who, by Which way, the reason Why, and Where? Scientists when developing a theory have to come up with an undisputable and somehow replicatable answer to these questions. The conventional and well known process after identifying a problem is to do a search on other theories and come up with an initial hypothesis, in simple terms, a superficial theory of what the solution seems to be, or in a more simpler word - a guess. An experiment is then carried out to test this hypothesis. This is a repeating process which continues to build on itself until a presentable answer is found.  </p>

  <h2 class="hidden">Limitations</h2>
  <p>Despite being full proof for many scientific problems, there are just some topics that cannot be proven or disproven by the scientific methodbecause they are beyond and above us. One of these topics being the human origin story.</p>
  <p>Yet, there are currently 4 major scientific theories that attempt in explaining the human origin</p>
  <br>

  <!-- Quantum Gravity Theories -->
 <h2 class="hidden">Quantum Gravity Theories</h2>
 <p class="hidden">
   <a style="color:blue" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory">String Theory &#128279;</a> and <a style="color:blue" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity">Loop Quantum Gravity &#128279;</a>  are grouped into this we call Quantum Gravity Theory. QGT aims to reconcile General Relativity (which simply tries to explain the macro-level structures of the universe) with Quantum Mechanics (simply describing the micro-level structures of the universe)
 </p>
<p class="hidden">This theory is itself theoretical as they are still being formulated. These theories lack testable predictions that can be verified with current technology and due to its extreme mathematical complexity, they are hard to work with and can sometimes predict phenomena which are beyond our ability to observer. There is no evidence to this effect. </p>
<br>
<br>

  <!-- Big Bang -->
  <h2 class="hidden">The Big Bang Theory</h2>
  <p class="hidden">
    Amongst some in the scientific community, the Big Bang is the most widely accepted explanation for the origin of the universe out of the other three. It posits that the universe began from a singularity - an extremely hot point with unimaginable pressure which had a sudden release of energy.

              The above is what is called a fossil radiation. Discovered by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson in 1965,this is basically the image produced from the most advanced telescope showing the remnants of light from the farthest parts of the universe, which cosmologists can use to get a glimpse into what it looked just 380,000 years after the big bang. Propenents of this theory propose that due to the uniformity of light as seen in the image, the theory of a single-dense point of light is supported.

  <h2 class="hidden">The Biblical Explanation</h2>
  
  <p class="hidden">
    There are various religions throughout the world that have some sort of origin story. One thing that is valid is that, irrespective of an individual's believe in a God, humanity's beginnings cannot be denied. 
  </p>

  <p class="hidden">Today, as always have been, there are two main divisions in explaning human orgin - Theistic and Atheistic. I do not believe that the division is between science and not-science. Albert Einstein throughout his life explicitly refused to refer to himself as 'atheistic' but considered himself 'agnostic' and a 'religious nonbeliever'. He did not believe in the existence of a physical God but believed that <b>"there is a lawgiver who sets the laws of the universe".</b> He rejected that there was a conflict between science and religion. He believed that the problem of God was, in his own words, <b>"the most difficult in the world"</b> - a question that could not be answered <b>"simply with a yes or no".</b> He believed this to be a problem greater for our minds to comprehend (To read more on what Einstein believed, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_philosophical_views_of_Albert_Einstein">Click Here</a>) </p>
<br>
  <p >
    <p class="hidden">Einstein, who was considered one of science greatest and more commonly known as the positor of the theory of General Relativity, a back bone to QGT, could not dispute the existence of a God. The reason being, there is no scientific evidence to prove otherwise. The question now is, is there scientific proof to prove the existence of a God? To prove this, we have to start from the beginning - the very beginning. </p>

    <h3 class="hidden" style="background-color: transparent;">Can the laws of Physics be violated?</h3>
    <p class="hidden">In Christianity, the bible offers explanation for human origin. A divine Being capable of matter manipulation at the subatomic level and creation of matter from nothingness. Interestingly enough, there is scale called the Kardashev scale which seems to define the existence of such a Being. This Being on Type VI of the Kardasheve scale is capable of creating and manipulating the multiverse, and is beyond time and space. This being for one, tends to be able to break all the laws of physics and this might initially seem to present a scientific loophole in this explanation. But if we are to consider the basis of Evolution, which is a direct child of the Big Bang, we did specify previously that proponents of the Big Bang in their explanations of the origin of the universe did make it clear that for the Big Bang to exist, a single particle of dense energy which defies the laws of Physics must be the origin of the universe. Therefore, scientifically, the Big Bang theory and all other theories evolving from it does provide the support that if there exists cosmic elements capable of violating laws of Physics, there can exist a non-coporal being capable of the same.
      </p>
    <br>
    
    <br>
    <h3 class="hidden" style="background-color: transparent;">Existence of Infinitely Existing Matter? </h3>
    <p>
      <p class="hidden">
      Christianity also explains the infinite existence of a God. Can this be proven? 
      <br>
      How can you know if something doesn't exist? In a search for your lost keys, you arrive at a possible location - a friend's house you have been to in the day, how can you ascertain that the keys do not exist in that location? Through thorough searching then concluding non-existence.
      <br>
      How do you know something exists? Scientifically, until proven otherwise, it is 100% safe to assume without searching that your keys indeed does exist somewhere.

      Therefore it is not a flaw in the Christian logic to say that there exists a God. But in order to disprove this, oen must have indeed searched the whole known universe and beyond and come up with a conclusion that there exists no God.
      </p>
      <br>
      
      <br>
      <p class="hidden">
      Again, the Big Bang Theory comes to the self-implicating aid of the Christian explanation to the existence of God. An assumption of the Big Bang or any other theory that exists of human origin is that there must always be something that has no beginning. For instance where did the energy from the Big Bang Singularity come from? Was it formed from something else or not? Assuming it wasn't created violates the Laws of Science (Law of Conservation of Mass) which says matter can't be created and also adds credibility to the Christian logic that there exists a non-created God. Also, assuming that it was formed causes another cycle of what created it and infinitely it goes on.

      <h3 class="hidden" style="background-color: transparent;">Existence Out of Space and Time?</h3>
      <p class="hidden">
        To give an explanation to a Physics defying God, Christianity posits that God exists out of space and time so He is not bound by the rules of what is created. Can this be proven?</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="hidden">
        Something more obvious and undeniable is the fact that the creator is not bound by the creation. An example is our human inventions - humans are not bound by codes and 'if' statements because we are the creators not the creation. So if indeed the last two points are convincing, then indeed this God cannot be bound by the laws of Physics or any observable and non-observable laws of the universe.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="hidden" style="background-color: transparent;">Direct Evidences of Existence</h3>
        
        <p class="hidden">
        I trust that, whether it be science or religion there is always an argument which cannot be proven just because it is beyond our abilities and is left to 'believing'. In religion, this 'believing' is called having faith. In Christianity, it is to have 'faith', faith that there exists a God and His Son, Jesus Christ came to this earth to die for the sins of the world and rise again on the third day into glory. For Science, it is to have a 'theory', a theory that for all time, there has always existed matter in one form or the other and theorizing otherwise breaks science.</p>

          Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, in collaboration with partners, is announcing support for human rabies vaccines for post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) as part of routine immunisation. Eligible countries are receiving guidance on how to access these vaccines under Gavi`s cofinancing policy. The first round of applications will be accepted by mid- July 2024. Ninety-five percent of human rabies deaths occur in Africa and Asia, most often in marginalised communities that lack access to care.
